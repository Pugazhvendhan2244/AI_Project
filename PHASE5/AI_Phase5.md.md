Certainly! Here's a README file that explains the code for measuring energy consumption from a dataset and how to use it:

# Energy Consumption Measurement

This Python script measures energy consumption using a dataset. It calculates the total energy consumption and provides a simple data visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. **Clone the script and dataset:**

   Clone the repository or download the Python script (`measure_energy_consumption.py`) and the dataset file (`dataset.csv`).

2. **Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Python script.**

   Ensure that `dataset.csv` and `measure_energy_consumption.py` are in the same folder.

3. **Run the script:**

   Execute the Python script in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python measure_energy_consumption.py
   ```

4. **Interpreting the output:**

   The script will load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, calculate the total energy consumption, and display a line plot showing the energy consumption over time.

## Dataset Format

The dataset should be in a CSV format. It must contain columns 'Datetime' and 'Energy', where 'Datetime' is the timestamp and 'Energy' is the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

## Data Preprocessing

The script converts the 'Datetime' column to a datetime object and sets it as the index for time series analysis.

## Visualization

The code generates a line plot showing the energy consumption over time. The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis shows energy consumption in kWh.

## Customization

To use this code with your dataset, ensure the 'Datetime' and 'Energy' columns are correctly named. Adjust the file path if the dataset is located in a different directory.
